Welcome to the alpha(1) version of the BodyAirDrum project !

A few details are available here:
https://github.com/honnet/BAD/wiki

The goal of the project is to design a midi instrument that cordlessly triggers samples using wearable pads placed on the body.
The system is composed of:
 - 2 Arduinos (Teensy in our case)
 - 2 nRF24L01 radio transceivers(2)
 - 4 binary pads
 - 1 mini-joystick pad

Checkout the android application repository:

Enjoy !
Jimmy & Drix, with the phenomenal help of Clement Moussu.

(2) Note: we used the nRF24L01 drivers from https://github.com/aaronds/arduino-nrf24l01
An Arduino port of the tinkerer.eu library. It works with the Sparkfun nRF24L01+ modules.
