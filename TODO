soft :
 * finish the joystick processing
 * interruptions on pads for a better reactivity
 * hack the compiler-upload chain to avoid mandatory reset at each upload
 * hack the bootloader/firmware of usb-midi (to change the midi device name)
 * optimiser consumption & reliability
 * website, videos, pictures...

hard :
 * test new pads in foam rubber, piezzo or other ?
 * test different alimentation (battery + switched-mode power supply / voltage regulator...)
 * put a non-usb midi output anyway ?
