Welcome to the BAD project AKA BodyAirDrum project !

The goal of the project is to design a midi instrument that cordlessly triggers samples using wearable pads placed on the body.
The system is composed of:
 - 2 Arduinos
 - 2 nRF24L01* radio transceivers
 - 2 binary pads
 - 2 mini-joysticks pads

Enjoy !
Jimmy & Drix.

*we used the nRF24L01 drivers from www.elecfreaks.com/480.html
An Arduino port of the tinkerer.eu library. It works with the Sparkfun nRF24L01+ modules.
